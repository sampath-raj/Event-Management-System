PIETECH EVENTS DATABASE CONNECTION FIX

STEPS TO IMPLEMENT:

1. Connect to your website's FTP server (https://pietech-events.is-best.net)

2. Upload the following updated files with the correct database connection settings:
   - config/database.php
   - includes/Database.php
   - connection_verify.php

3. Test the database connection by accessing:
   https://pietech-events.is-best.net/connection_verify.php

4. If the connection test is successful (shows green "Connection successful" message):
   - Go to the admin panel and test the attendance features
   - Verify that reports can be downloaded correctly

5. If the connection test fails:
   - Check the error message
   - Verify the database credentials with your hosting provider
   - Make sure the database server name "sql209.hstn.me" is correct

IMPORTANT DATABASE CONFIGURATION:
- Host: sql209.hstn.me  (External MySQL server)
- Database: mseet_38774389_events
- Username: mseet_38774389  (Note: Previously we used mseet_38774389_events which was incorrect)
- Password: ridhan93
