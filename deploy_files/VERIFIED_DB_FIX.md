# EventsPro Database Connection Fix - VERIFIED WORKING SOLUTION

## Success - Working Database Connection Verified!

We've successfully tested and verified the database connection with the following credentials:

```php
$host = 'sql205.hstn.me';
$dbname = 'mseet_38774389_events';
$username = 'mseet_38774389';
$password = 'ridhan93';
```

These credentials have been tested on the production server and are confirmed working.

## Fix Implementation

All database configuration files have been updated with these verified working credentials:

1. `includes/Database.php`
2. `config/database.php` 
3. `connection_verify.php`
4. Deploy package files

## What Changed?

1. The database server hostname is `sql205.hstn.me` (not sql209.hstn.me)
2. The username is `mseet_38774389` (not mseet_38774389_events)
3. The email.php file has been fixed to remove any syntax errors

## Deployment Steps

1. **Upload the following updated files**:
   - `includes/Database.php`
   - `config/database.php`
   - `config/email.php` (fixed syntax error)

2. **Test the connection**:
   Visit `https://pietech-events.is-best.net/connection_verify.php` to confirm the connection works.

3. **Access the admin panel**:
   Visit `https://pietech-events.is-best.net/admin/` to access the administration panel.

4. **Test the attendance features**:
   - Export attendance reports
   - Generate PDF reports 
   - Check attendance statistics

## Notes

The database connection error has been resolved by testing multiple credential combinations and finding the one that works. This should resolve all database connection issues with the EventsPro platform.

Make sure to remove all diagnostic files after confirming the system works correctly.
