# EventsPro Fix Package

## Current Issues
1. Database connection fails with "Access denied" errors
2. PHP syntax error in email.php file

## Files to Fix

### 1. Database Connection Files
The database connection is failing because:
- Wrong hostname (`sql205.hstn.me` instead of `sql209.hstn.me`)
- Incorrect username (using `mseet_38774389` instead of `mseet_38774389_events`)

### 2. Email Configuration File
The `email.php` file has a syntax error with an unexpected `<` token.

## Fix Implementation

1. Upload these files to your hosting account via FTP:

   - `includes/Database.php` - Updated with correct hostname and username
   - `config/database.php` - Updated with correct hostname and username
   - `config/email.php` - Fixed syntax error
   - `connection_verify.php` - A test script to verify the connection works

2. After uploading the files, verify that:
   - The database connection works by visiting: https://pietech-events.is-best.net/connection_verify.php
   - The site no longer shows the maintenance page
   - The admin features including attendance tracking work correctly

## Correct Database Credentials

```
Host: sql209.hstn.me
Database: mseet_38774389_events  
Username: mseet_38774389_events
Password: ridhan93
```

## Testing & Verification

After uploading the files, you should:

1. Check that the database connection test passes
2. Login to the admin area and verify functionality
3. Test the attendance export features
4. Ensure that email functionality works (if used)
