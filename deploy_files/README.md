# EventsPro Database Connection Fix

## Problem Overview
The EventsPro platform is currently showing a database connection error when deployed to the production environment. The error message "SQLSTATE[HY000] [2002] No such file or directory" indicates an issue with the database host configuration.

## Root Cause
The production server requires connections to an external MySQL server at `sql209.hstn.me` rather than connecting to `localhost` or `127.0.0.1`. Additionally, the correct username for the database is `mseet_38774389_events` which matches the database name.

## Fix Implementation

### 1. Update Database Configuration Files
Replace these files on the production server:

- **includes/Database.php**  
  This file contains the main database connection class. Upload the version from `deploy_files/Database.php` to replace the existing one.

- **config/database.php**  
  This file contains the database configuration parameters. Upload the version from `deploy_files/config_database.php` to replace the existing one.

### 2. Upload Diagnostic Tools
Upload these files to help diagnose any remaining issues:

- **connection_verify.php**  
  A simple connection test script that confirms the database connection works.

- **db_diagnostics.php**  
  A comprehensive diagnostic tool that provides detailed information about the database connection.

### 3. Testing Steps

1. **Basic Connection Test**
   - Access `https://pietech-events.is-best.net/connection_verify.php` to verify the basic connection works.
   - You should see a green "Connection successful!" message and a list of tables.

2. **Advanced Diagnostics**
   - If the basic test fails, access `https://pietech-events.is-best.net/db_diagnostics.php` for detailed diagnostics.
   - This script will test multiple connection methods and show any errors.

3. **Functional Testing**
   - If the connection tests pass, try accessing the admin area at `/admin`
   - Test the attendance features and report generation

### 4. Cleanup
After confirming everything works correctly, remove these temporary diagnostic files:
- `connection_verify.php`
- `db_diagnostics.php`
